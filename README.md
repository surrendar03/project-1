# REDBUS
We have developed a cloned version of a popular bus ticketing and booking platform called redBus. redBus is a renowned online bus ticketing service in India, allowing users to book tickets through its website, iOS, and Android apps. It connects bus travelers with over 3000 bus operators,

In this project, we aimed to create a near-perfect replica of redBus, offering similar features and functionality for users to seamlessly book bus tickets online. The platform serves travelers across multiple regions in India, including Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, South Bengal, and West Bengal.
